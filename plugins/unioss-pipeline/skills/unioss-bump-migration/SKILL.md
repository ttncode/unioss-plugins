# Unioss Migration Bumper

Use this skill to update a set of migrations (and associated configs/tests) from an old timestamp to a new one.

## 1. Parameters

- **OLD_TS**: 14-digit timestamp of target migrations (e.g., `20260114101209`).
- **NEW_TS**: 14-digit replacement timestamp (provided by user or current time via `date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S"`).

## 2. Locations

- **Migrations**: `AdminPage/application/migrations/{production,staging,testing,virtualbox_direct_domain}/`
  - Format: `<TS>_<action>_<ticket>_<index>.php`
- **Configs**: `AdminPage/application/config/{production,staging,virtualbox_direct_domain}/migration.php`
- **Tests**: `AdminPage/application/tests/migrations/`
  - File: `Migration_<TS>_test.php`

## 3. Workflow

### A. Rename & Update Migrations

1. Find all PHP files starting with `OLD_TS_`.
2. **Reindex**: Calculate a `NEW_INDEX` for each file. This must be a unique, monotonically increasing number (e.g., `001`, `002`) that is greater than the index of the **most recent migration** (the one with the highest timestamp) in that environment's migration folder. **CRITICAL**: Do not simply use the absolute maximum index found in the directory, as some folders contain outlier files with very high indices (e.g., `1471`) from much older timestamps. Always sort files by timestamp first to identify the current active sequence index.
3. **Rename**: Replace `OLD_TS` with `NEW_TS` and update the trailing index to `NEW_INDEX`.
4. **Update Class Name**: Update the class name inside the file to match the new filename `timestamp (new) + action + ticket + index (new)`.

### B. Update Config Files

In `production`, `staging`, and `virtualbox_direct_domain` config folders:

1. Locate the `migration_version` lines.
2. **Remove** any line (commented or active) containing `OLD_TS`.
3. **If OLD_TS was the active version**: Simply replace `OLD_TS` with `NEW_TS` in that line.
4. **If OLD_TS was NOT active**:
   - Comment out the current active `migration_version`.
   - Insert `$config['migration_version'] = NEW_TS;` as the new active version.
5. No empty line between migrations versions in config files

#### Example (Config Update)

**Case: OLD_TS is NOT the active version**

```php
// Before (OLD_TS = 20260109100000)
#$config['migration_version'] = 20260109100000;
#$config['migration_version'] = 20260109150000;
$config['migration_version'] = 20260110180000;

// After (NEW_TS = 20260111180000)
#$config['migration_version'] = 20260109150000;
#$config['migration_version'] = 20260110180000;
$config['migration_version'] = 20260111180000;
```

**Case: OLD_TS IS the active version**

```php
// Before (OLD_TS = 20260110180000)
#$config['migration_version'] = 20260109150000;
$config['migration_version'] = 20260110180000;

// After (NEW_TS = 20260111180000)
#$config['migration_version'] = 20260109150000;
$config['migration_version'] = 20260111180000;
```

### C. Update Migration Tests

1. **Rename**: `Migration_<OLD_TS>_test.php` to `Migration_<NEW_TS>_test.php`.
2. **Update Content**:
   - Replace `OLD_TS` with `NEW_TS` in class name and references.
   - Set `MIGRATION_VERSION_UP` constant to `NEW_TS`.
   - Set `MIGRATION_VERSION_DOWN` constant to the latest timestamp remaining in the migration directory (the version to revert to).

## 4. Verification

- Run `rg "<OLD_TS>"` to ensure no stale references remain in `AdminPage/application`.
- Verify class names exactly match new filenames.
- Ensure config files have exactly one active `migration_version` matching `NEW_TS`.
- Summarize changes: `NEW_TS` used, files renamed, and config diff snippet.
